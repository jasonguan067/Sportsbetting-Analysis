### üèà Sports Betting Dashboard
 ## Project Details

This project tracks and analyzes my personal sports betting history to uncover trends, improve decision-making, and better understand my performance over time. It's a practical application of data analysis to something I engage with regularly, providing clear visualizations of profitability, win rates, and betting behavior across platforms and sports.

## Problem Statement:
I wanted a better way to understand my sports betting results. Rather than relying on gut feeling, I used data to answer:
Which sportsbooks and sports am I most profitable in?
What times or days are most profitable for placing bets?
How consistent is my win rate across time and categories?

## Dataset Used
I exported my sports betting data using Pikkit, an app that tracks all of my bets. The dataset consists of 1,218 bets placed between December 2023 and April 2025. Each row captures information including:

- Bet amount

- Profit or loss

- Sportsbook

- Sport

- Time and date placed

-Outcome (win/loss)

## Tools & Techniques
Power BI: Built a comprehensive interactive dashboard with slicers and custom visualizations.

Used bar and line charts to show ROI, profit over time, and win rate by sport.

Leveraged DAX formulas to calculate custom KPIs like win rate, ROI, and monthly performance.

Excel: Cleaned and prepared the dataset using IF, VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, and TEXT functions; created Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to analyze early trends; used conditional formatting and slicers to make insights more interactive and visually intuitive.

Data Cleaning: Normalized inconsistent text labels, converted time columns for hour-level analysis, and filtered out test entries.

## Key Insights
My highest profit came from PrizePicks with over $1,000 gained.

Basketball bets accounted for ~62% of all wagers and showed a solid win rate.

My best performance came from bets placed in March and April, and during evening hours.

Identified that I lose the most on Chalkboard Fantasy, suggesting reconsideration of that platform and sticking to profitable platforms.
